# Instructions on how to add a bookmarklet

A bookmarklet is a bookmark stored in a web browser that contains JavaScript commands that add new features to the browser.
The javascript commands are written inside the bookmark's URL.

## For Chrome
1. From this repository we can copy the JavaScript code titled download_wikipedia_images.js. We will paste this code somewhere later on.
2. Press `CTRL + d` or `⌘ + d` on MAC to create a new bookmark for Google Chrome. You should now see a pop-up that says Edit bookmark.
